<p>Flutter is a trending technology this year. This article will suggest some free and paid ways to learn how to develop iOS and Android applications with Flutter.</p><h2 id="are-you-interested-in-mobile-application-development">Are you interested in mobile application development?</h2><p>If your answer is yes, you are reading the right article! Maybe you don't know about Flutter yet, but don't worry – I wrote an article about <a href="https://herewecode.io/blog/what-is-flutter-and-why-you-should-learn-it-in-2020/">what flutter is and why you should learn it this year</a>.</p><blockquote>Flutter is a free and open-source mobile UI framework created by Google and released in May 2017. In a few words, this allows you to create a native mobile application with only one code. It means that you can use one programming language and one codebase to create two different apps (IOS and Android). – <a href="https://herewecode.io/blog/what-is-flutter-and-why-you-should-learn-it-in-2020/">What is Flutter and Why You Should Learn It in 2020</a></blockquote><p>In this post, I share with you two types of content, free or paid. I tried to find excellent resources to support every type of learner (videos, courses, books, tutorials, and so on).</p><p>Before we start, I also wrote an article about <a href="https://herewecode.io/blog/should-you-learn-programming-with-paid-or-free-content-and-why/">whether you should you learn to code with paid or free content - and why?</a> If you don't know what type of content is the best for you, I recommend that you read that article before reading this one.</p><p>So let's get started. I tried to explain each resource with a small paragraph. All information came from the description of the associated website. As you can imagine, I haven't tried all these methods. If you need more details, I invite you to visit the linked website.</p><h2 id="free-content">Free content</h2><h3 id="videos-courses">Videos/Courses</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ej_Pcr4uC2Q">Dart Programming Tutorial - Full Course</a></li></ul><p>A freeCodeCamp full course on Dart.</p><blockquote>Learn the Dart programming language in this complete tutorial for beginners.

The website provides a guided, tutorial-based, hands-on coding experience. I have just discovered this site. You can even use it outside of Flutter. It references all the Google technologies with many tutorials to help you use them.</p><blockquote>Most codelabs will step you through the process of building a small application or adding a new feature to an existing application. They cover a wide range of topics such as Android Wear, Google Compute Engine, Project Tango, and Google APIs on iOS. – Google Codelabs</blockquote><h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3><p>Something I love about Flutter is the <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs">documentation</a>. It’s complete and can be helpful when you are learning or developing an application.</p><p>The documentation goes through many topics, such as:</p><ul><li>How to start with Flutter</li><li>All the available widgets</li><li>The API docs (libraries docs)</li><li>A cookbook with a lot of tutorials</li><li>Some examples of apps</li><li>The Flutter Youtube channel</li></ul><h3 id="books">Books</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.syncfusion.com/ebooks/flutter-succinctly">Flutter Succinctly</a></li></ul><p>By searching through the Flutter documentation, I found this book.
